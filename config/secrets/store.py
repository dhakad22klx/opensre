"""The one place that decides where an OpenSRE secret is read from and written to.

Every surface that persists or resolves a credential goes through here, so the
tier order is stated once instead of being re-derived at each call site:

    read   env  ->  OS keyring  ->  local fallback file
    write  OS keyring, falling back to the local file only when the keyring
           genuinely cannot store it
    delete both tiers, always

The delete rule is not symmetry for its own sake: clearing only the keyring
would leave a fallback copy that the read path happily resolves, so ``opensre
auth logout`` would report success while the credential kept working.
