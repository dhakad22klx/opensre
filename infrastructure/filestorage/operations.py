"""Remote-sync actions a surface invokes.

CLI (``opensre remote-sync``), interactive shell (``/remote-sync``), and
gateway clients all call here, so none of them re-implements config loading,
store building, or engine ordering. Surfaces own only their own I/O.

**Stateless:** no cached config, ObjectStore, or report. Every call re-reads
env/settings, resolves roots for the current scope, and builds a fresh store.
**Thread-safe:** safe to call concurrently from many turns; results are newly
allocated and not shared. Two syncs of the same roots can still race at the
filesystem / object-store layer (last writer wins) — that is external I/O.

Roots come from ``sessions_dir()`` / ``get_memory_dir()``, so the active
principal scope (laptop home vs org user tree) is already applied.

User-facing wording lives in :mod:`infrastructure.filestorage.messages`.
